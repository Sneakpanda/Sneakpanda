Hey, I am Joshua Sherrard and I am currently making games for fun! I have one game published on steam with plans of having another.

You can check out my projects on my itch.io page: 
https://sneak-panda.itch.io/

Check out my steam game here: 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127870/LuIdle/

Lu[Idle], my game on steam, is my first ever coding project, so its pretty bad. My other projects are much better.

You can reach me at jsherrard25@gmail.com
